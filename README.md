# Algorithmic Thinking

This is a [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) project configured for ephemeral development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).
I'm using this environment to practice coding by solving the problems from the book "Algorithmic Thinking: A Problem-Based Introduction" by Daniel Zingaro

## Next Steps

### An existing project

To get started with C on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

The project brings you a Makefile, command line options parsing, colors for pretty printing, [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) report and unittest using [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/). 

The template was created by Gustavo Pantuza and for detailed informations, check out the [Documentation wiki](https://github.com/pantuza/c-project-template/wiki).
 
After cloning the repository you'll need to adjust `PROJECT_NAME` in the `project.conf` to match the name of your git repository.
