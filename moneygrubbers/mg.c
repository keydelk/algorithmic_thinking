The store has a price for buying one appleâ€”for example, $ 1.75. The store also 
has m pricing schemes, where each pricing scheme gives a number n and a price 
p for buying n apples. For example, one pricing scheme might state that three 
apples cost a total of $ 4.00; another might state that two apples cost a total 
of $ 2.50. You want to buy at least k apples and to do so as cheaply as possible.

Input:  Read test cases until there's no more input. Each test case consists of
        the following lines:
            - A line containing the price for one apple, followed by the number
                m of pricing schemes for this test case. m is at most 20.
            - m lines, each of which gives a number n and a total price p for 
                buying n apples. n is between 1 and 100.
            - A line containing integers, where each integer k is between 0 and
                100 and gives the desired number of apples to buy.
        Each price is a floating-point number with exactly two decimal digits.

Output: For each test case, output the following:
            - A line containing "Case: c:" where c is the test case number
                starting at 1.
            - For each integer k, a line containing "Buy k for $ d" where d is 
                the cheapest way we can buy at least k apples.

This is the recursion solution from Algorithmic Thinking
Trying Allman style braces for this problem rather than the Kernel style.
